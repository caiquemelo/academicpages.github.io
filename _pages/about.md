I am PhD student in Economics at the Graduate Program in Economics (Pimes) at the Federal University of Pernambuco and research assistant of the Group of Evaluation of Public and Economic Policies [(GAPPE)](https://www.gappe.org/). 

My research interests focus on applied microeconometrics, particularly in crime, education, health, labor, and migration.
